            <p>
              Hayao Miyazaki (born January 5, 1941) is a Japanese animator, director, producer, screenwriter, author, and manga artist. A co-founder of Studio Ghibli, he is widely regarded as one of the most accomplished filmmakers in the history of animation. Miyazaki's works are characterized by their imaginative storytelling, richly detailed worlds, and themes of environmentalism, pacifism, and feminism.
              <br /><br />
              Some of his most notable films include *My Neighbor Totoro* (1988), *Princess Mononoke* (1997), *Spirited Away* (2001), which won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, and *Howl's Moving Castle* (2004). His films have received critical acclaim and have been commercially successful worldwide.
              <br /><br />
              Miyazaki retired multiple times but returned to filmmaking, with his latest project being *The Boy and the Heron* (2023). His influence on animation and storytelling has inspired countless creators and continues to shape the industry.

                                    A goldfish sneaks away from home and floats off on the back of a jellyfish. 
                                    After getting stuck in a glass jar, she drifts to the shore where she is 
                                    freed by Sousuke, a five-year-old boy who lives with his mother Lisa in a 
                                    house by the sea while his father Koichi works on a fishing boat. After 
                                    healing a cut on Sousuke's finger by licking it, the goldfish is named 
                                    Ponyo by her new friend.Unknown to Sousuke, Ponyo already has a name and 
                                    a family. Her father Fujimoto, a sorcerer who forsook his humanity to 
                                    live underwater, searches frantically for his daughter Brunhilde. When 
                                    found and captured, Ponyo rejects her birth name and declares that she 
                                    wants to become a human. Using the power received from Sousuke's blood, 
                                    she grows arms and legs and escapes to the surface once more. But the 
                                    magic released into the ocean causes an imbalance in nature, causing the 
                                    Moon to start falling out of orbit and the tides to grow dangerously 
                                    stronger. Reunited with Ponyo, Sousuke must pass an ancient test to 
                                    restore order in the world and let his companion live on as a human.

                                    down in the coastal town of Koriko, Kiki struggles to adapt and ends up 
                                    wandering the streets with no place to stay—until she encounters Osono, who 
                                    offers Kiki boarding in exchange for making deliveries for her small bakery.
                                    Before long, Kiki decides to open her own courier service by broomstick, 
                                    beginning her journey to independence. In attempting to find her place 
                                    among the townsfolk, Kiki brings with her exciting new experiences and 
                                    comes to understand the true meaning of responsibility.

                                    In 1950s Japan, Tatsuo Kusakabe relocates himself and his two daughters,

                                    Chasing it into the forest, she finds "Totoro"—a giant, mystical forest spirit 
                                    whom she soon befriends. Before long, Satsuki too meets Totoro, and the two

                                    fantastical creatures of the woods.
